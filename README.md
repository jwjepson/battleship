## Project Description: 
- The goal of this project was to create a Battleship game, using TDD (Test driven development), specifically using Jest. This project was meant to encapsulate everything that I've learned so far in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum, including using factory functions to create objects used in the game. 

## What I've learned:
- Continued practice using factory functions to create objects in game (GameBoard, Ship, Player).
- Unit Tests
- How to install and use jest to write unit tests for my code.
- Continued practice using webpack for asset management, specifically for CSS and Fonts, and for code minification. 
- Continued practice using modules and ES6 Import and Export syntax. 
- Using data-attributes on elements to create a Grid.
- Using private variables and methods inside factory functions. 
- Using JSON.stringify in order to compare two objects, though Lodash might be a more useful option in the future.
- Continued practice using CSS Grid and flexbox.




## Final Thoughts:
This Battleship project was a lot of fun to create and really helped solidify my knowledge using factory functions, and to introduce me to TDD using Jest. One of the things that I hope to improve upon, is better organizing my code and separating DOM manipulation from the game logic as much as I can. In addition, I hope as I continue to learn about Data Structures and Algorithms, I can write more concise and scalable code. Overall, I really enjoyed the challenge that this Battleship project brought!
